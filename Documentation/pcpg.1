.SH NAME
pcpg \- parse Xcode project plists and generate placeholder class code
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pcpg
.I project.pbxproj
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B pcpg
utility is a small helper that reads an Xcode project property list (the
.I project.pbxproj
inside a .xcodeproj bundle) and infers the classes referenced by the
.IB objects
section. For every class it sees, it emits paired header and source files in
the current working directory containing ivar declarations and simple getter
and setter methods. This is intended as a metatool to help the libs-xcode
maintainer map unknown or missing classes when parsing Xcode projects.
.PP
.B pcpg
expects a single argument: the path to the plist or project file to inspect.
If no argument is provided it exits without generating output.
.SH OUTPUT
For each class discovered,
.B pcpg
writes
.I ClassName.h
and
.I ClassName.m
files alongside where the tool was invoked. These stubs include imports for
referenced types and generate minimal accessor methods based on the keys and
value types found in the plist.
.SH EXAMPLES
Invoke the tool against a project file inside a bundle:
.PP
.I pcpg MyApp.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
.PP
Generate stubs from a standalone plist snapshot:
.PP
.I pcpg /tmp/project-dump.plist
.SH BUGS
The tool currently accepts only one positional argument and performs no
validation beyond loading the plist. If the input is malformed or incomplete,
the generated stubs may be unusable. Report issues on the libs-xcode tracker.
.SH HISTORY
.B pcpg
was written in August 2011 as an internal exploration tool and remains
lightweight and experimental.
